# hero-kids
A collection of code snippets for HERO Kids

The first application is a checklist/to-do list for kids. My wife and I use the app Carrot on iOS and we wanted to set up something of a daily checklist for our girls. HERODaily aims to keep the kids focused on daily goals (set by parents) by rewarding them with points and badges.
NOTE: This is definitely a work in progress, for example it is almost completely unstyled and I still need to tweak/add some functions (addPoints.php, etc.) but you get the idea.
